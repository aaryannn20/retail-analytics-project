## 📊 Technical Deep Dive

### Machine Learning Implementation
```python
# Customer Segmentation Pipeline
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score

# Feature engineering
features = ['total_spent', 'order_frequency', 'avg_order_value', 'recency']
scaler = StandardScaler()
features_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(customer_data[features])

# Optimal cluster selection
silhouette_scores = []
for k in range(2, 8):
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42, n_init=10)
    labels = kmeans.fit_predict(features_scaled)
    silhouette_scores.append(silhouette_score(features_scaled, labels))

optimal_k = np.argmax(silhouette_scores) + 2  # k=2 selected
```

### Statistical Validation Results
- **Silhouette Score**: 0.265 (acceptable cluster separation)
- **Business Interpretability**: Clear behavioral differences between segments
- **Statistical Significance**: Validated through bootstrap sampling
